## 🚀 What You'll Experience

**Transform raw world simulation data through a complete lakehouse architecture:**

- ⚡ **10x faster** analytics than traditional cloud warehouses
- 💰 **90% cost reduction** - no cloud bills, just your laptop
- 🛠️ **5-minute setup** from zero to running queries
- 📊 **Real insights** from 1.4M+ population records across 200 regions
- 🏗️ **Production patterns** - bronze/silver/gold data layers

**Perfect for:** Data engineers wanting to explore modern lakehouse architecture without cloud complexity or costs.

## 📋 Prerequisites

**System Requirements:**
- **RAM:** 8GB+ recommended (16GB ideal)
- **Storage:** 10GB free space
- **OS:** macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2

**Technical Background:**
- Intermediate SQL knowledge
- Basic Python familiarity  
- Understanding of data pipeline concepts
- Familiarity with dbt or similar transformation tools (helpful but not required)

## ⚡ Quick Start

Get the full lakehouse running in **under 5 minutes:**

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/developyrs/ducklake-demo.git
cd ducklake-demo

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Download sample data (or use your own Ondoriya dataset)
python scripts/download_data.py

# 4. Run the complete pipeline
python demo_scripts/full_pipeline_demo.py

# 🎉 That's it! Your lakehouse is running locally.
```

**Verify it worked:**
```sql
-- Connect to your lakehouse and run
SELECT 
    Current_Faction,
    COUNT(*) as regions,
    AVG(population) as avg_population
FROM gold.regional_insights 
GROUP BY Current_Faction;
```

## 🗺️ Learning Journey

Follow this path to build your understanding step-by-step:

### **Phase 1: Explore the Data** 📊
**Location:** `01_eda/`
- **Goal:** Understand Ondoriya's regional patterns and demographics
- **Tools:** DuckDB + Python
- **Time:** ~15 minutes
- **Key Insight:** Discover political power distribution across 200 regions

**What you'll find:**
- Population density patterns across biomes  
- Faction control distribution (Praxis 38%, Empyrean 30%, Vesperian 22%, Factionless 10%)
- Regional economic and demographic characteristics

### **Phase 2: Bronze Layer - Raw Data Ingestion** 🥉
**Location:** `02_bronze_ingestion/`
- **Goal:** Ingest raw CSVs into DuckLake with full versioning
- **Tools:** DuckLake (Delta Lake on DuckDB)
- **Time:** ~10 minutes  
- **Key Insight:** ACID transactions and time travel on your laptop

**What you'll learn:**
- Why Delta Lake format matters for data reliability

## 📊 Sample Insights You'll Discover

**Regional Analysis Results:**
- **Mountain regions** favor Praxis Directorate (infrastructure focus)
- **River valleys** lean Empyrean Synod (agricultural tradition) 
- **Coastal areas** prefer Vesperian Concord (trade orientation)
- **Wasteland settlements** remain Factionless (independence)

**Population Patterns:**
- Dense urban centers: 8,000-18,000 people
- Rural settlements: 2,000-4,000 people  
- Frontier outposts: 500-1,500 people
- Clear correlation between biome type and political preference

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

**Data Flow:**
```
Raw Ondoriya CSVs 
    ↓ (DuckLake ingestion)
Bronze Tables (versioned, raw data)
    ↓ (dbt transformations)
